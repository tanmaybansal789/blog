I am a A-Level student, interested in **machine learning**, **software engineering**, and **mathematics**.

This blog is for **longer-form thinking** about:
- my projects (which will be on my [Github](https://github.com/tanmaybansal789/)).
- **standalone posts** on topics I simply find interesting.
- longer **explainer series** on specific subjects.
